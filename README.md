# MSK-Books-and-Shelf

# Swift lab 2: swiftlab1 - books and shelves

## Goal

learn how to use multiple classes, Arrays and functions. 

## what's on the making

Create class Book. A book has name (can’t be changed after creation), purchaseid (can’t be changed after creation), and market price (can be changed).

Create class Shelf. A shelf has name (that can’t be changed after creation) and a set of books (that can be changed by calling add and delete methods and is unique on book purchaseid - ie. doesn’t have duplicate purchaseids). Shelf also has a method for computing the average price of books in the shelf.

Pay attention to checking that values in Book and Shelf objects are legal, where appropriate. Create multiple books and multiple shelves and verify that your implementation works in a reasonable way. Write, for example, code to create a listing of all book names, filter the books with conditions on their market prices etc. Use assert statements where appropriate. Note: classes can be defined in a playground and mixed with code that uses them.
